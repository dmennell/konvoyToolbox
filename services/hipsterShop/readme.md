#Hipster Shop

Connect to Cluster and run this from kubectl
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/master/release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
```
This example deploys the Hipster shop through a Load Balancer.  Hipster shop has built-in load generation functionality that can be run within the cluster to make graphs look good.
