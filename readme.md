# Honey Badger's Konvoy Toolbox
This is my personal Konvoy Toolbox of scripts, commands, and instructions to do different things with Konvoy

* the BUTTONS directory includes some shell scripts that can be double clicked to run their specific functions.  This should make it easy to deploy Konvoy Klusters without having to go into the CLI

* the INSTALL directory includes install examples for different envirtonments

* the SERVICES directory provides instructions to deploy different services to Konvoy
